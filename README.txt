The two folders contain the code used to produce the results and analyses presented in "Pandemic infection forecasting through compartmental model and learning-based approaches".

Model Code MATLAB folder:
	.m files used for 
		1. the description of the SIDAREVH model,
		2. the infection rates model-based estimation involved in SIDAREVH model,
		3. the infected population prediction using the model-based estimated infection rates,
		4. the infected population prediction using the learning-based predicted infection rates.

Learning Code Python folder:
	.py files used for the learning-based prediction of the future values of the infection rates involved in SIDAREVH model.
